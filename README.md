## Getting Started

### Installing dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Running the server

```
npm run dev
```

## Developing

To run type-checking, linting, and tests, simply run:

```
npm run check
```

### Linting the codebase

```
npm run lint
```

or, with autofix:

```
npm run lint --fix
```

### Fixing with Prettier

This app uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io), and you can auto-format all files with

```
npm run format
```

## Working with the mobile wallet locally

To enable interactions with the mobile wallet, we need to update our environment to point to
an IP address rather than localhost.

For example:

```sh
touch .env.development.local
echo "HOSTNAME=192.168.4.31" >> .env.development.local
```

## Sample Users

To minimize dependencies, we use an in-memory data store in lieu of a database.
The following users are added by default:

| id  | email          | password |
| --- | -------------- | -------- |
| 1   | alice@test.com | testing  |
| 2   | bob@test.com   | testing  |

## Sample DID Document

A did:web identifier must be prefixed with a fully qualified domain name that is secured by a TLS/SSL certificate; for now, a sample one is available at [http://localhost:3000/.well-known/did.json](http://localhost:3000/.well-known/did.json) with domain https://www.example.com.
