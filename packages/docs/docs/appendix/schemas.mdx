## KYC/AML Attestation

```json
{
  "@type": "KYCAMLAttestation",
  "authorityId": "did:web:verity.id",
  "approvalDate": "2021-08-25T02:13:43.387Z",
  "authorityName": "Verity",
  "authorityUrl": "https://verity.id",
  "authorityCallbackUrl": "https://identity.verity.id",
  "serviceProviders": [
    {
      "@type": "KYCAMLProvider",
      "name": "Some Service",
      "score": 200
    }
  ]
}
```

## Credit / Risk Rating Attestation

```json
{
  "@type": "CreditScoreAttestation",
  "score": 700,
  "scoreType": "Credit Rating",
  "provider": "Experian"
}
```

## Address Ownership

### Purpose

This model provides a schema to express ownership of a cryptographic private key for any chain that uses public-private key cryptography in address ownership.

This schema avoids arbitrary signatures and promotes an interoperable approach to proving key ownership, and it is useful when embedded in other schemas and protocols (such as the counterparty exchange protocol and the credit score schema).

### Example

Issue: add example

### Attributes

#### "@type" Attribute

The "@type" attribute for an Address Ownership attestation MUST be "AddressOwner". Use of this attribute is REQUIRED.

#### "chain" Attribute

The "chain" attribute is used to define which blockchain the attestation is applicable to. The "chain" attribute value is a single-word, lower-case string containing the full name of the chain, without spaces. Testnets hyphenated at the end of the primary name (e.g., 'ethereum-ropsten'). Use of this attribute is REQUIRED.

Issue: provide more details

#### "address" Attribute

The "address" attribute is used to define the address on the indicated chain. The "address" attribute value is a single-word, lower-case string containing the full name of the chain, without spaces. Testnets MUST be hyphenated at the end of the primary name (e.g., 'ethereum-ropsten'). Use of this attribute is REQUIRED.

Issue: provide more details

#### "proof" Attribute

The "proof" attribute is used to define the proof of address ownership. The "proof" attribute value is generated by concatenating chain, address, and VC issuanceDate, and then sign that message with the private key that owns the public chain address. Use of this attribute is REQUIRED.

Issue: clean up

### Recommendations

- A credential containing an `AddressOwner` attestation SHOULD be considered a snapshot of key ownership at a point in time.
- Issuers SHOULD prefer setting a quick expiration on an `AddressOwner` attestation credential (rather than rely on crerdential revocation)

## Counterparty Compliance

TODO

```json
{
  "@type": "CounterpartyPerson",
  "accountNumber": string,
  "accountSource": string
}
```
