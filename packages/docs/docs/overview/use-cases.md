# Use Cases

Verity does not prescribe specific use cases for its protocols, however it does (a) define missing data models (schemas) that should be shared and common building blocks for all parties, and (b) define the missing protocol/pattern for requesting and delivering claims in a manner that supports member use cases.

With a set of common data models and agreed upon patterns for identity, several new use cases can emerge in the crypto ecosystem including:

- Marketplaces and exchanges validate customer identity without storing large honeypots of personal data
- Finance becomes more globally inclusive, reaches the un/under-banked, and no longer locked in first-world identity silos
- Crypto wallets meet regulatory obligations (e.g., Travel Rule) when transacting large incoming crypto without leaking PII
- Accredited investor credentials unlock security token exchange
- FX markets become more efficient atop compliant global blockchains
- Lending leverages decentralized credit and risk scoring to improve collateralization requirements
- NFT provenance is tracked when collectibles transition to new owners
- Insurance credentials unlock sophisticated DeFi and physical world transactions
- Artists and other content creators earn royalty splits mapped to identity as content is distributed
- People decide how their identity information is shared with other people, products, and services rather than have it sold unwittingly
- Law enforcement has a clearer path to policing financial crime without hindering innovation
