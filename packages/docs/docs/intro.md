# Introducing Verity

## Vision

We envision an open, shared, interoperable architecture for identity and trust in decentralized finance. We are committed to scalable, reliable, privacy-preserving ways to integrate identity into decentralized financial interactions, and to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements when engaging in blockchain and smart contract activity.

Defining, trusting, empowering, and protecting identity remains among the internet’s hardest problems. The web would be more powerful if it understood identity as well as it understands document server addresses. But technical, economic, legal, and sociological barriers and misaligned incentives have challenged progress on identity protocols throughout the internet’s history.

Web 1.0 and 2.0 identity models emerged in the form of centralized silos where customer identity data is often tracked, bought and sold, breached or otherwise exposed, and generally managed outside of the control of individuals themselves. A new approach to identity is needed to unlock the value of emerging decentralized Web 3.0 applications, including DeFi and NFT scenarios today, where older centralized internet identity models either do not work at all, or (worse) are unsafe.

In recent years, technical advancements in cryptography and blockchains have enabled new trust architectures over open networks, leading to decentralized identity architectures. Alongside these technical advancements, incentives to address identity in domains such as finance have achieved escape velocity: decentralized financial use cases boast massive and growing value and promise to extend access to new markets to everyone who can connect. Critical regulatory pressure to address identity also accompanies these domains, adding urgency to create shared industry-wide standard solutions.

These three forces -- new technologies for cryptographic trust, high-value global market opportunities, and regulatory urgency -- accelerate progress toward a vision of identity for Web 3.0, the next era of internet applications.

We believe now is the time for Verity: A collection of standard decentralized identity protocols that empower developers, financial institutions, regulators, and individuals with an open, interoperable identity model for decentralized finance.
