# Introducing Verity

Traditional identity approaches remain fundamentally at odds with cryptocurrency and DeFi use cases, making them difficult to apply even where identity information could be helpful. Some examples include:

- proof of reputation for improved access to finance or more agreeable terms
- voting or similar use cases requiring [sybil resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack)

This is because traditional identity solutions are based upon massive data silos that serve as honey pots for attackers. Combining these with on-chain transactions could lead to disclosure of personal information on a massive scale.

Decentralized identity is a fundamentally different approach that's ideally suited for and consistent with the principles of crypto:

- Decentralized
- Persistent and portable
- Cryptographically verifiable
- Resolvable and interoperable
- Transparent
- Private by design

## What is Verity?

Verity leverages decentralized identity standards and supplies the missing elements needed for crypto finance, by providing:

1. Essential schemas such as proof of blockchain address ownership and reputation.
2. Protocols and recipes for requesting, issuing, and verifying verifiable credentials in a way that is open, transparent, and usable by anyone.
3. Patterns enabling use of credentials in the context of a pending blockchain transaction.
4. Sample code and tests illustrating the implementation of the schemas and recipes.

Verity does not introduce new decentralized identity standards or duplicate existing identity infrastructure; it integrates into your existing infrastructure in a standards-based way.
