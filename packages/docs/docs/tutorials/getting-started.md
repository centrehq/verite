# Getting Started

Verity has provided several interactive demos as well as sample projects to showcase some use-cases of the Verity standards. The code is freely available on [Github](https://github.com/centrehq/demo-site). To run all of the demos, you will need code found in two repositories: `demo-site` and `demo-wallet`.

1. Setup and run Verity's [demo-site](https://github.com/centrehq/demo-site/blob/main/README.md)
2. Setup and run Verity's [demo-wallet](https://github.com/centrehq/demo-wallet/blob/main/README.md)
3. Select a demo in demo-site to be guided through the steps

The `demo-site` repository also hosts several standalone code samples to assist in developing your own solution. Those samples are located at:

- `packages/demo-issuer`
- `packages/demo-verifier`
- `packages/demo-revocation`
