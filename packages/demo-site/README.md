## Sample DID Document

A did:web identifier must be prefixed with a fully qualified domain name that is secured by a TLS/SSL certificate; for now, a sample one is available at [http://localhost:3000/.well-known/did.json](http://localhost:3000/.well-known/did.json) with domain https://www.example.com.
